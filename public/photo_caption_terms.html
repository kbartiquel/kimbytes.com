        <div class="container">
                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>By downloading or using the Photo Captions AI app, these terms will automatically apply
                        to you – you should make sure, therefore, that you read them carefully before using the app.</p>

                <h2>2. Ownership and Use</h2>
                <p>You're not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.
                        You're not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn't try
                        to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all
                        the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to
                        it, still belong to Kimbert Bartiquel. Kimbert Bartiquel is committed to ensuring that the app
                        is as useful and efficient as possible.</p>

                <h2>3. Changes and Charges</h2>
                <p>For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at
                        any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making
                        it very clear to you exactly what you're paying for.</p>

                <h2>4. Data Handling</h2>
                <p>The Photo Captions AI app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to
                        us, to provide our service. It's your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app
                        secure. We recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone.</p>

                <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions, including Google
                        Analytics for Firebase and Firebase Crashlytics.</p>

                <h2>6. Internet Connection</h2>
                <p>Certain functions of the app will require an active internet connection. We cannot take
                        responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi,
                        and you don't have any of your data allowance left.</p>

                <h2>7. User Responsibility</h2>
                <p>If you're using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the
                        agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. You may be charged by your mobile
                        provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app or
                        other third-party charges. In using the app, you're accepting responsibility for any such
                        charges, including roaming data charges.</p>

                <h2>8. Updates and Termination</h2>
                <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. We do not promise that we will always update the app so
                        that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your
                        device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. We
                        may also wish to stop providing the app and may terminate use of it at any time without giving
                        notice of termination to you.</p>

                <h2>9. Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h2>
                <p>I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                        periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
                        Conditions on this page. These terms and conditions are effective as of 2023-04-13.</p>

                <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
